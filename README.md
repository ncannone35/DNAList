Lab 4 - DNA List

In this lab, we manipulated sequences of DNA and RNA using different methods through linked lists and enumeration.  Such methods
included inserting sequences at different posistions, removing sequences from certain positions, printing all, as well as
specific sequences, cliping sequences, copying sequences, and transcribing sequences.  The program prints error messages
if input is not allowed.
The DNAList.java file contains the main method, as well as most helper methods.  The LList.java file contains the linked list
implementation class.  The Sequence.java file contains a class that creates the Sequence object, containing an enum variable
and the sequence itself.
